# Fullstack QA - API Task Repository

This repository contains my submission for the Fullstack QA API Task from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zde4UDdbn9ShzBOyFGWqDzAR-R4bo44TGetghTm7hpU/edit?tab=t.0 

The repository includes:
- A **Postman collection** consisting of 4 primary requests, each with embedded scripts to fulfill the required tasks. 
  Additionally, 2 supplementary requests are executed dynamically within the scripts to complete the workflows
- Two GitHub Actions workflows (feel free to follow Actions tab to view runs):
  1. Running tests using **Postman CLI**
  2. Running tests using **Newman**. There is also an artifact attached - ZIP file with an HTML report inside (Htmlextra) 

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission!
